# Design Tokens

Design tokens help ensure consistency across your UI. These are the foundational values for your design system.

## Colors
The color palette defines the primary, secondary, and accent colors used throughout the system.

```json
{
  "primary": "#007bff",
  "secondary": "#6c757d",
  "accent": "#ff5733"
}

## Typography
We use the following font families and sizes:

Primary font: Roboto
